# python-ml-sockets
A quick little lab I did to play around with transferring a scikit-learn ML model over WebSockets using Python

## Technologies Used
* Python
* WebSockets
* scikit-learn library
* pickle library (for serialization)

## Note
I would not recommend using the pickle library to serialize any production level data. I just used it in this instance for simplicity.
